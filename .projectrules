# .cursorrules

You are an expert Frontend Engineer.
Your goal is to implement the "MindMap" application with "Native-App-like" performance.

# CRITICAL INSTRUCTION (THE CONSTITUTION)
Before writing any code, you MUST always read and strictly follow `docs/MINDMAP_UX_RULES.md`.
This file is the Single Source of Truth for UX and Technical Constraints.

# WORKFLOW
1. **Understand**: Read the user's request and the current `MINDMAP_UX_RULES.md`.
2. **Update Rules**: If the request requires a behavior change, UPDATE `MINDMAP_UX_RULES.md` FIRST.
3. **Implement**: Write code that strictly adheres to the updated rules.
4. **Verify**: Ensure no regressions in "Optimistic UI" or "Focus Management".

# BEHAVIOR
- NEVER prioritize "Database Consistency" over "UI Responsiveness".
- If existing code conflicts with the Rules, rewrite the code to match the Rules.
